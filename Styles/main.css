/* Target
Above but with 'nautical/battleship theme and detailing' similar general design philosophy - fleshed out interactive console with custom game option/ high-score display for each difficulty with name (set Captain: XXX Time on Mission:XXX)
Cells styled with shadowing/3d effect
Sound design, nautical greetings, explosion, good job when you when (tally ho etc.)
Responsive design to push and simplify interactive menu/console to E/M/H above game
